Getting started
  Before proceeding you’ll need to have the last stabel NodeJS and npm installed on your machine.
  You can use nvm (macOS/Linux) or nvm-windows to switch Node versions between different projects.

  1. Install dependencies
    Open the project folder and install it’s dependencies. You can use any package manager you want. We recommend Yarn or npm.

    cd (the folder you just cloned the proj into)
    npm install
    
   2. Start development server
    Once the installation is done, you can now run your app by running npm start or yarn start.

    npm start
    You will see something similar to:
